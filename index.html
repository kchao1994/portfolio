			<div id="developer-content">
				<p>My primary interest is in programming. Aside from my formal studies in computer science, a large part of my childhood was spent in front of the computer building/designing websites after stumbling upon the art form on accident at age 11 whilst browsing Pokemon fan content. Something clicked and and I am happy to say that coding has been a large part of my life since then.</p>

				<p>Most of my expertise is in web development, but I'm always looking for new ways to apply my talents! Check out my personal projects listed below, ranging from full-blown websites to small code snippets.</p>

				<h3>Poisson Image Splicer</h3>
				<div class="project-content">
					<div class="left">
						<div class="info stack">Flask</div>
						<div class="info stack">Redis</div>
						<div class="info view"><a href="/poisson" target="_blank">View</a></div>
						<div class="info pencil"><a href="http://github.com/#TODO" target="_blank">Git Repo</a></div>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						A small web application inspired by a really fun homework assignment in my Image Processing class. I decided, upon conclusion of the class, to port the code from Matlab to Python and create a web interface for it using Flask.
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>The Silver Islands</h3>
				<div class="project-content">
					<div class="left">
						<div class="info stack">Django</div>
						<div class="info view"><a href="http://silver-islands.com/" target="_blank">View</a></div>
						<div class="info pencil"><a href="http://github.com/#TODO" target="_blank">Git Repo</a></div>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						Pokemon art website that I used to develop in my free time. I created it in 2006 and therefore represents the origin of my interest in computers and coding. From maintaining this website I've learned about design, ways to create interactive/useful content, SEO, how to manage a small community of ~100 members, and much, much more. I used to maintain it almost daily throughout middle school and high school, although sadly, since the beginning of college and beyong, it's fallen off my radar. I hope to one day restore it to its former glory, though.

				<h3>Stopwatch</h3>
				<div class="project-content">
					<div class="left">
						<div class="info stack">Javascript</div>
						<div class="info view"><a href="stopwatch.html" target="_blank">View</a></div>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						A simple web based stopwatch, one that counts up and one that counts down, created as a way for me to break into Javascript.
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Angry Charmander Shooting Game</h3>
				<div class="project-content">
					<div class="left">
						<div class="info stack">Action Script</div>
						<div class="info stack">Flash CS4</div>
						<div class="info view"><a href="angrycharmander.html" target="_blank">View</a></div>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						I wanted to explore animation and the art of creating Flash games. Using the helpful <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/labs" target="_blank">Kongregate shootorials</a> as reference, I created Shooting Charmander.

				<p>I've also been known to draw in my free time (although, sadly, this hobby has taken quite a nose dive since graduating high school). <a href="http://finished-eraser.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Visit my art blog</a>, where I upload sketches and completed works.</p>

				<p>Also, the doodles on each page of the website were drawn by me! Here are some other samples of my artwork.</p>
